An Indian housewife spends most of her time in the kitchen – her day starts in the kitchen and ends in the kitchen – and the entire family gets their basic life energy from food that is prepared in the kitchen. One can even say that the kitchen is the backbone of the house.  In earlier times, the kitchen was situated in an open space. This helped the kitchen access as much light as possible and made it easier to dispel smoke rising from the stove. Today, most of us have closed kitchens.

The kitchen should, ideally, be located between the southern and eastern directions, i.e. in the southeast direction of the plot.

In the above reference, two datasets were created, using red and white wine samples. The inputs include objective tests (e.g. PH values) and the output is based on sensory data (median of at least 3 evaluations made by wine experts). Each expert graded the wine quality between 0 (very bad) and 10 (very excellent). Several data mining methods were applied to model these datasets under a regression approach. Th...",

In fact, by 2020, every individual on the world is expected to create 1.7MB of data each second . Google is the largest player in the sector, with 87.35 percent of the global search engine market share in 2021. This equates to 1.2 trillion searches each year and over 40,000 queries every second . This produced huge amounts of data, known as big data. Massive data sets generated from a number of sources are referred to as big data. These data sets, due to their magnitude and complexity, cannot be collected, stored, or analysed using any of the existing traditional procedures. As a result, several tools, including as NoSQL, Hadoop, and Spark, are used to investigate massive data sets. Using big data analysis technologies, we collect various types of data from more diverse sources, such as digital media, web services, business applications, machine log data, and s...",

A field goal is worth two points, unless made from behind the three-point line, when it is worth three. After a foul, timed play stops and the player fouled or designated to shoot a technical foul is given one, two or three one-point free throws. The team with the most points at the end of the game wins, but if regulation play expires with the score tied, an additional period of play (overtime) is mandated.  Players advance the ball by bouncing it while walking or running (dribbling) or by passing it to a teammate, both of which require considera...",
