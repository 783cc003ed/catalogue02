An Indian housewife spends most of her time in the kitchen – her day starts in the kitchen and ends in the kitchen – and the entire family gets their basic life energy from food that is prepared in the kitchen. One can even say that the kitchen is the backbone of the house.  In earlier times, the kitchen was situated in an open space. This helped the kitchen access as much light as possible and made it easier to dispel smoke rising from the stove. Today, most of us have closed kitchens.

The kitchen should, ideally, be located between the southern and eastern directions, i.e. in the southeast direction of the plot.

In the above reference, two datasets were created, using red and white wine samples. The inputs include objective tests (e.g. PH values) and the output is based on sensory data (median of at least 3 evaluations made by wine experts). Each expert graded the wine quality between 0 (very bad) and 10 (very excellent). Several data mining methods were applied to model these datasets under a regression approach. Th...",
