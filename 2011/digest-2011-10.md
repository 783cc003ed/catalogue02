This is a project im doing for my programming classes at GU(Gentofte Youth school) Its a java library for importing into eclipse when doing an android app and a cross platform app for getting the 'duks' of the week ( duks is the person who is gonna clean the classroom after school) We are gonna have a server wich is gonna hold multiple schools and grades branches students etc. The java apps is supposed to use the api just for interfacing with the server and fetching data. its for easy and innovative administration of the 'duks'. If it becomes a succes well expand and add more features. Follow me for more info about the other subjects such as the server side scripts the client side scripts and the web interface. Feel free to download and modify, you can even put your own name on it... but i would love if you gave me credit! :D Im not working alone tho.. I have a full team of 5 including me.
