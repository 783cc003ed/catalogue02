Doing it individually is a time taken job hence I have created this colab notebook for the same.

And this appears like a web page for restoring their personal photos. Click on the play button at the corner of each code block. There are two code blocks.

Measureless opportunities to scale up and relative cheapness, compared to other reaching-out channels, are the two reasons why the email marketing is fair-haired by businesses. However, this is not about the price and physical extent alone.  The chief advantage is a better alignment of communication with customers. If you hope a certain content strategy brings desirable results, overlooking the quality of mailing messages will be a sorry pitfall. Always keep in mind that newsletters, welcome, retention, and other emails are not just a brand's facade - but a powerful tool for generating conversions. By joining sides of email and content strategies, you can come up with synergy from both. In this guide, we’ll cover a few recommendations for content marketers on how to write email messages that w...",
