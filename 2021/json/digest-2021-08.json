Right now, mainstream confirmation components are for the most part based the accompanying variables: something that the client has (an item), knows (a mystery), or extraordinarily speaks to him (biometric identifiers). In the easiest structure, a framework that requires verification challenges the client for a mystery, commonly a couple of username and secret word. The section of the right pair awards access on the framework's administrations or assets. Shockingly, this methodology is defenseless to a few weaknesses and disadvantages.

    "description": "With the increasing popularity of IoT devices, the vulnerabilities &amp;amp; security issues concerned with these devices are also increasing. The lack of security mechanisms and vulnerable protocols make IoT devices easy targets for hackers, for example, the “Mirai Botnet Attack” in 2016. There is a very critical requirement for security of IoT systems. In this paper, we propose the IDRBT-IoT Secure Router (IISR), which is immune to a large number of cyber attacks. IISR protects the network against malicious activities by providing a one-step solution for securing the IoT ecosystem. It consists of a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+, five IoT devices, and an attacker machine. The router has been tested by conducting ten attacks namely: Deauthentication, Fake-Authentication, MAC Spoofing, Denial of Service, Port Scanning, WiFi Cracking, ARP Poisoning, DNS Spoofing, Malware Injection, and Firmware Exploitation. We developed security mechanisms for detection and mitigation of these attacks. They consi...",

It often allows an attacker to view files on the application server filesystem, and to interact with any back-end or external systems that the application itself can access. In some situations, an attacker can escalate an XXE attack to compromise the underlying server or other back-end infrastructure, by leveraging the XXE vulnerability to perform server-side request forgery (SSRF) attacks.",

A few years ago, the creation of the software and hardware image processing systems was mainly  limited to the development of the user interface, which most of the programmers of each firm were  engaged in. The situation has been significantly changed with the advent of the Windows operating  system when the majority of the developers switched to solving the problems of image processing itself.
