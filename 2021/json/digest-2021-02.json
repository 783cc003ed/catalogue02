The admin has an important role in the management of this system.  For the user section, the users are the staff members of the restaurant. Every staff has their account and they can log in to do the task. The staff as a waiter can go to take order with the phone having this app instead of a pen and paper. The food you select comes with the cost as well. And the staff as a chef can smoothly work in the orders without having the waiter to go to them.

Most of the time, a customizable Robot simulator is not available to the researcher. Some good options are available in the market, but their price is too high, not affordable. After much research, we found a better solution around all aspects, fully customizable and entirely free of cost. There are two sides. One is a 3D view of robotics ARM, and another is a joint controller of robotics ARM. For 3D simulation, CoppeliaSim is the best option. It is free of cost and Open Source.
