The project is developed for helping the restaurants by making the digital order taking system. The project contains an admin and user side. All the management like editing site contents, adding staff, updating food items, and checking order status can be managed from the admin side. The admin has an important role in the management of this system.  For the user section, the users are the staff members of the restaurant. Every staff has their account and they can log in to do the task. The staff as a waiter can go to take order with the phone having this app instead of a pen and paper. The food you select comes with the cost as well. And the staff as a chef can smoothly work in the orders without having the waiter to go to them. This project makes a convenient way for staff to manage orders...",

Clickthrough rate (CTR) can be used to gauge how well your keywords and ads are performing.           - CTR is the number of clicks that your ad receives divided by the number of times your ad is shown: clicks ÷ impressions = CTR. For example, if you had 5 clicks and 100 impressions, then your CTR would be 5%.                   - Each of your ads and keywords have their own CTRs that you can see listed in your account.                               - A high CTR is a good indication that users find your ads helpful and relevant. CTR also contributes to your keyword's expected CTR, which is a component of Ad Rank.
