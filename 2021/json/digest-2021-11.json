This project is insight into the design and implementation of a Pharmacy Management System. This is done by creating a database of the available medicines in the shop. The primary aim of pharmacy management system is to improve accuracy and enhance safety and efficiency in the pharmaceutical store. The aim of this project is to develop software for the effective management of a pharmaceutical store. We have developed this software for ensuring effective policing by providing statistics of the drugs in stock.  Description on the topic: This program can be used in any pharmaceutical shops having a database to maintain. The software used can generate reports, as per the user’s requirements. The software can print invoices, bills, receipts etc. It can also maintain the record of supplies sent in by the supplier.

Today, ML is powering data driven use-cases that are transforming industries around the world. In order to seize and hold it's competitive advantage business needs to reduce risk therefore a new expertise rises to include data science models in operational systems.  According to Gartner Research “While many organizations have experimented with AI proofs of concept, there are still major blockers to operationalizing its development. IT leaders must strive to move beyond the POC to ensure that more projects get to production and that they do so at scale to deliver business value. (July 2020)”.
