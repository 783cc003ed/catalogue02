The site was simple at the beginning, not even checking to see if moves were legal. He made the site open source, which means anyone is free to read the source code and make contributions. Gradually, the site improved and collected users as an enthusiastic volunteer staff assembled to help Thibault build and maintain the site.Vlounteer's may can fork on our Git project  Today, Lichess users play more than a million games every day. Lichess is one of the most popular chess websites in the world while remaining 100% free. Most “free” websites subsist by selling ads or selling user data. Others do it by putting all the good stuff behind paywalls. Lichess does none of these things and never will.

    "description": "This is a boot2root VM and is a continuation of the Basic Pentesting series. This series is designed to help newcomers to penetration testing develop pentesting skills and have fun exploring part of the offensive side of security.  VirtualBox is the recommended platform for this challenge (though it should also work with VMware -- however, I haven’t tested that).  This VM is a moderate step up in difficulty from the first entry in this series. If you’ve solved the first entry and have tried a few other beginner-oriented challenges, this VM should be a good next step. Once again, this challenge contains multiple initial exploitation vectors and privilege escalation vulnerabilities.  Your goal is to remotely attack the VM, gain root privileges, and read the flag located at /root/flag.txt. Once you’ve finished, try to find other vectors you might have missed! If you’d like to send me a link to your writeup, enjoyed the VM or have questions or feedback, feel free to contact me at: josiah@v...",
