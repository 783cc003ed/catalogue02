    "description": "A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a &amp;quot;dock&amp;quot; which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.     A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state.

In order to do this, complete information about the first half of a user’s listening session is provided, while the prediction is to be carried out on the second half.

The output of a prediction is a binary variable for each track in the second half of the session indicating if it was skipped or not, with a 1 indicating that the track skipped, and a 0 indicating that the track was not skipped.",

    "description": "What is JavaScript and what does it do?   Before you start learning something new, it’s important to understand exactly what it is and what it does. This is especially useful when it comes to mastering a new programming language.  In simple terms, JavaScript is a programming language used to make websites interactive. If you think about the basic makeup of a website, you have HTML, which describes and defines the basic content and structure of the website, then you have CSS, which tells the browser how this HTML content should be displayed—determining things like color and font. With just HTML and CSS, you have a website that looks good but doesn’t actually do much. JavaScript brings the website to life by adding functionality. JavaScript is responsible for elements that the user can interact with, such as drop-down menus, modal windows, and contact forms. It is also used to create things like animations, video players, and interactive maps.  Nowadays, JavaScript is an all-purpose prog...",

Most XSS website hacking attacks use malicious Javascript scripts that are embedded in hyperlinks. When the user clicks the link, it might steal personal information, hijack a web session, take over a user account, or change the advertisements that are being displayed on a page.
