As the numbers of accommodations growing, how can we provide new users with personalized recommendations to help them save time when they do their first booking on Airbnb?  Every users have different preferences. By exploiting and analyzing old users’ personal information and web session records, we can predict which country will a new user most likely choose with his/her basic information.  For this project, we will build a system to make a prediction about the destination country of every new user’s first booking.",

While FluidReview is a great drag-and-drop application builder, it lacks some out-of-the-box customization. The platform allows the builder to drop in a javascript box. The javascript box only applies to that application page (so, if a form has multiple pages, you'll need each page to have the javascript box dropped in). More about the javascript box here: https://fluidreview.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002494634-JavaScript-Question.
