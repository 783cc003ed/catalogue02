But you're not going to actually write any articles; instead, you'll flex your Mongoose and Cheerio muscles to scrape news from another site.  &amp;&#35;35;&amp;&#35;35;&amp;&#35;35; Before You Begin  1. Create a GitHub repo for this assignment and clone it to your computer. Any name will do -- just make sure it's related to this project in some fashion.  2. Run `npm init`. When that's finished, install and save these npm packages:  3. express  4. express-handlebars  5. mongoose  6. body-parser  7. cheerio  8. request  9. **NOTE**: If you want to earn complete credit for your work, you must use all six of these packages in your assignment.  10. In order to deploy your project to Heroku, you must set up an mLab provision. mLab is remote MongoDB database that Heroku supports natively. Follow these steps to get it running:  11.

They have injection moulding machines that take in PET resin to produce the bricks. Management would like to have a dashboard to monitor the production. The machines are connected to an application called ‘DB’ that receives production data from the machines. The data per machine is of the following type: - Machine name - Variable name - Datetime from - Datetime to - Value in that timeframe Each machine produces this set of data for (variable names) - PRODUCTION: Number of pieces produced (gross output including bad ones) - SCRAP: Number of pieces which are bad (these will be reground and fed into the machine’s PET intake again) - CORE TEMPERATURE: The temperature in degrees Celsius of the machine. On top of that the machine will tell the DB application whether or not it is running. Every change in this state will be stored in the DB application using the following scheme...",
