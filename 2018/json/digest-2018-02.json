You need to take care of a lot of things before leaving home, and especially if you have an air conditioner unit in your home because your negligence can harm your unit. You probably know that the AC units are designed to work uninterruptedly, and they may misbehave because of the unusual break. So, donâ€™t forget to do the following tasks before going on the vacations otherwise, you will need to pay a certain amount of money as the cost of the professional service of the AC repair Miami.  Turn Down Your Unit Instead of Turning Off: As already mentioned above that the air conditioners have been designed to work regularly (without any interruption) and if you keep your unit switch off for a long time period, then the chances of misbehaving of the unit are also increased. Many of its important components could be deteriorated during this time period and may also run at decreased capacity when put back into the regular use after...",

The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory. As a bonus task, you can program your app to track product sales across your store's departments and then provide a summary of the highest-grossing departments in the store.  Make sure you save and require the MySQL and Inquirer npm packages in your homework files--your app will need them for data input and storage.   Submission Guide  Make sure you use the normal GitHub. Because this is a CLI App, there will be no need to deploy it to Heroku. This time, though, you need to include screenshots, a gif, and/or a video showing us that you got the app working with no bugs. You can include these screenshots or a link to a video in a README.md file.   Include screenshots (or a video) of typical user flows through your application (for the customer and if relevant the...",
