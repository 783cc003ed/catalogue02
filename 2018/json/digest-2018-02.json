    "description": "Your PPC account is never perfect. Hopefully, that doesn’t come as a surprise to you. The truth of the matter is that no matter how hard you work on building an account and optimizing it according to best practices, you will probably miss something. An even truer statement is that the longer you work in an account, the easier it is for things to slip past your ever-watchful eye. What is a PPC account audit? An account audit is a dive into your account to determine areas that could use further attention or work to improve performance. We’ll outline the actual process of the audit shortly. When and why should I audit? There’s never a bad time to audit your account because you’ll typically find something to help improve performance. However, you don’t particularly want to audit your account after a recent strategy change or account update. You could be auditing based on skewed information and nobody wants that. The most important time to audit your account is if you’re having performance ...",

You need to take care of a lot of things before leaving home, and especially if you have an air conditioner unit in your home because your negligence can harm your unit. You probably know that the AC units are designed to work uninterruptedly, and they may misbehave because of the unusual break. So, don’t forget to do the following tasks before going on the vacations otherwise, you will need to pay a certain amount of money as the cost of the professional service of the AC repair Miami.  Turn Down Your Unit Instead of Turning Off: As already mentioned above that the air conditioners have been designed to work regularly (without any interruption) and if you keep your unit switch off for a long time period, then the chances of misbehaving of the unit are also increased.
