We tried to debug the app by enabling each feature at a time and found that the memory consumption is high when there is a SQLite plugin call. The memory consumed is never released even after we are idle for few minutes. To ensure that the memory consumption is from the SQLite plugin, we created a new project which performed the below operations 路         as a single record, 路         as a batch operation, 路         with a loop of n records 路         with a loop of n batches   The source code is uploaded,  for the sample project in this repository. Instruments captured during analysis is also attached, for following operations,       1. Insert - with a (batch of 100 records each) * 100 loop       2. Select - with a loop of 100   Further analysis: Found the memory consumption was less by 5 to 6 MB if the t...",
