But you're not going to actually write any articles; instead, you'll flex your Mongoose and Cheerio muscles to scrape news from another site.  &amp;&#35;35;&amp;&#35;35;&amp;&#35;35; Before You Begin  1. Create a GitHub repo for this assignment and clone it to your computer. Any name will do -- just make sure it's related to this project in some fashion.  2. Run `npm init`. When that's finished, install and save these npm packages:     1. express     2. express-handlebars     3. mongoose     4. cheerio     5. axios  3. **NOTE**: If you want to earn complete credit for your work, you must use all five of these packages in your assignment.  4. In order to deploy your project to Heroku, you must set up an mLab provision. mLab is remote MongoDB database that Heroku supports natively. Follow these steps to get it running:  5.

Data such as volume, sphericity and area has been extracted using a state-of-the-art Phasefocus microscope along with their cell tracking software, which captures images of label-free cells and with minimal light. As the image data has been collected overtime, one can observe how the physical properties of the cell change overtime. The cells treated with Staurosporine have been treated with two concentrations, 3.7mM and 33.3mM. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA), a machine learning algorithm, was used to classify untreated and treated cells for the Docetaxel drug. LDA was also used to classify cells treated with the two concentrations of Staurosporine. Further to this, pixel boundary da...",

    "description": "The need for a secure communication gives rise to concept of cryptography. Data encryption or ciphering translates data into another form, or code, so that only people with access to a secret key (formally called a decryption key) or password can read it. Encrypted data is commonly referred to as ciphertext, while unencrypted data is called plaintext. Cryptography or cryptology is the practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of third parties called adversaries. In cryptography, a cipher is an algorithm for performing encryption or decryption—a series of well-defined steps that can be followed as a procedure. Computational cryptography deals with the storage and processing of sensitive information in computer systems by enciphering. Sensitive information is information that for some reason must be protected from being disclosed to individuals without proper authorization.

This project presents a simple and portable approach to detect spoofed webpages and solve security vulnerabilities using Machine Learning.  It can be easily operated by anyone since all the major tasks are happening in the backend. The user is required to provide URL as input to the GUI and click on submit button. The output is shown as “YES” for phishing URL and “NO” for not phished URL.  PYTHON DEPENDENCIES:  • NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn: For Data cleaning, Data analysis and Data modelling. • Pickle: For exporting the model to local machine  • Tkinter, Pyqt, QtDesigner: For building up the Graphical User Interface (GUI) of the software.    To avoid the pain of installing independent packages and libraries of python, install Anaconda from www.anaconda.com. It is a Python data science platform which has all the ML libraries, Data analysis libraries, Jupyter N...",

    "description": "This is a fun app or game, mainly developed for the fun in passive guessing, active analysis and the beauty of randomness which occurs in nature. Also, this will help gather data on random guessing of numbers given time and other factors. There is this little understanding/ knowledge which is by intuition that individuals guessing of numbers at a certain time of the day in the presence of some factors could be predicted given data of previous guessing. That is, individual have favorite numbers even if they are just guessing at a point in time. Guess king is a proposed interactive application or game that will engage uses in guessing and predicting numbers. It will have single player and multiplayer mode. Single player mode will feature the application generating a random number, and three other random numbers to form a set of number and ask the user / player to predict the first number generated with 3 options. Should the user/ player get the first guess write, he / she scores 5 point ...",
