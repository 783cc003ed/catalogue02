Your first major task is a research project on employees of the corporation from the 1980s and 1990s. All that remain of the database of employees from that period are six CSV files.  In this assignment, you will design the tables to hold data in the CSVs, import the CSVs into a SQL database, and answer questions about the data. In other words, you will perform:  1. Data Modeling  2. Data Engineering  3. Data Analysis  &amp;&#35;35;&amp;&#35;35; Instructions  &amp;&#35;35;&amp;&#35;35;&amp;&#35;35;&amp;&#35;35; Data Modeling  Inspect the CSVs and sketch out an ERD of the tables. Feel free to use a tool like [http://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com](http://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com).  &amp;&#35;35;&amp;&#35;35;&amp;&#35;35;&amp;&#35;35; Data Engineering  * Use the information you have to create a table schema for each of the six CSV files.

But due to lack of skilled resources they were unable to do so.  2.Potential Option for Data Migration from ECC to S/4 - Since the ECC system was very old, SAP is unable to provide a direct migration scripts for data migration. This has resulted a big challenge for the client. So they are looking RPA to automate the data migration by automatically fetching the records from ECC and creating the same in S/4.   Challenges (with respect to this particular process):  1. Client used to get Sales Order creation request from multiple sources.  2.Their back-office team used to collate those request in an excel sheet from reading the invoice PDF. Once the data is available, back-office user used to take input data from excel sheet and enter into SAP ECC system.  3.The whole process of creating Sales Order is time consuming and ...",

    "description": "SIP is widely used signaling protocol for controlling the communication on the internet, maintaining, establishing as well as terminating the sessions.  It works on the application layer which can create, modify and terminate sessions with the participants. It supports multimedia sessions/services on both wired and wireless networks like multimedia distribution, internet telephone calls.  We are implementing Cryptanalysis for a secure mutual authentication which is based on Elliptical Curve Discrete Logarithm problem for SIP which is immune to the attacks.  Authentication is a crucial process when a remote user wants to get services from a corresponding sever.  Most environment communications of SIP are unsafe which naturally raises the issue of providing security protection for communicating participants.  Therefore, we are trying to design a robust and efficient mutual authentication which is meaningful and interesting. ",

    "description": "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks are a type of injection, in which malicious scripts are injected into otherwise benign and trusted websites. XSS attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious code, generally in the form of a browser side script, to a different end user. Flaws that allow these attacks to succeed are quite widespread and occur anywhere a web application uses input from a user within the output it generates without validating or encoding it.   An attacker can use XSS to send a malicious script to an unsuspecting user. The end user’s browser has no way to know that the script should not be trusted, and will execute the script. Because it thinks the script came from a trusted source, the malicious script can access any cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information retained by the browser and used with that site. These scripts can even rewrite the content of the HTML page.   These 3 types of XSS are defined as follows:    Stored XSS (AK...",
