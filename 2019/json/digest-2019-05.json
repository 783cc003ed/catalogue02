So ultimately my today’s post is absolutely spotlighted on the huge and the vast difference in career opportunities in pursuing SAS after B.Pharm rather than any job or M.Pharm.      The Main difference is that the course duration for any Post graduation will be minimum 1-3 years whereas SAS certification the course time period will be around 2-6 months. If you go M. Pharm the career investment will be 3- 4 Lakhs, it's so tough and it isn't satisfaction.  There is no doubt jobs are available but the job vacancies will be very high. As a result of knowledge and skills, students fail to acquire the job. In comparison, after completion of SAS certification course in 6 months, there is higher demand in industry and the current market as large no. of vacancies available but less no. of candidates due to lac...",

We will use AWS to launch and host the Linux server. AWS might seem a little confusing at this point. Don’t worry, we will gain much more hands-on experience with AWS throughout the course. The goal is to get you comfortable working with the technology and not overwhelm you with all the details.  Requirements You need to have a personal AWS account and GitHub account for this assignment. You should also read the Git Hands-on Guide and Linux Hands-on Guide before beginning this exercise.  A word about grading One of the key DevOps practices we learn about in this class is the use of automation to increase the speed and repeatability of processes. Automation is utilized during the assignment grading process to review and assess your work.  It’s important that you follow the instructions in each assignment and type i...",
