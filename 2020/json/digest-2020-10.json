Machine learning algorithms build a mathematical model based on sample data, known as &amp;quot;training data&amp;quot;, to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so.   The launch of quantum computing is giving rise to exciting research areas that seek to leverage the principles of quantum mechanics to increase machine learning or vice versa.  The field that uses the Quantum computer has machine learning tools is known as Quantum Machine Learning (QML). Where the goal is to improve classical machine learning algorithms by outsourcing complicated computations to a quantum computer or to optimize quantum algorithms using classical machine learning architectures, both fall within the scope of diversity of machine learning.  In this session, we will try to learn a bit more about the learner topic.",

Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a &amp;quot;dock&amp;quot; which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.   A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state.
